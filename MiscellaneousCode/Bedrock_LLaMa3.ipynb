She’s a community therapist-in-training with a side hustle selling handmade ceramics under the brand Earthtone. Her vibe is soft sage green, clean desk, windows open, incense gently burning. She grew up with immigrant parents who emphasized resilience and self-reflection. Her dad taught her how to meditate when she was 12, and her mom taught her how to advocate for herself with grace. Talia now volunteers at a youth center doing art therapy with teens navigating heavy stuff. She’s the friend who actually checks in with a voice memo and says “no pressure to respond, just love you.” She’s been in a healthy, communicative relationship with her partner, Seyi, for three years. They have a weekly “emotional inventory night” that’s mostly snacks and snuggles and “how are we really doing?” chats.\n",
