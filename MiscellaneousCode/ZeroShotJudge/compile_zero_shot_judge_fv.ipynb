The gaze shifts both widely (e.g., [227, 664] to [187, 163] to [803, 147]) and selectively, moving across kites of various colors and shapes, and then to groups of people on the beach ([973, 903], [87, 909]).

Then it returns to the dynamic middle and upper areas rich with colorful kites, and finally progresses to the right side where taller structures and large kites are visible.

It begins centrally (662, 508), traverses to salient elements across the scene (i.e., from the dolphin and central fish cluster to the left edge where colorful fish groups are, then sharply to the top-right quadrant where large marine animals are present), and revisits central regions, which is consistent with known human eye-movement patterns.

It starts with a central fixation at [648, 504], possibly drawn to a dense cluster of fish. It then moves in a somewhat coherent manner around salient, colorful, and interesting regions — such as schools of striped fish, vibrant coral formations, and areas with eye-catching red-orange fish. There are both short and long saccades, with revisits to areas rich in visual information (like [1103, 727] revisiting a visually salient region previously seen at [1127, 705]). The sequence overall mimics how human vision might meander through a busy underwater scene, attending to colorful, high-contrast features in a non-linear but content-driven way.

It begins near the center of the image, which aligns with the common central fixation bias seen in humans. It then explores various distinct and semantically rich regions (e.g., toy dolls, colorful packaging, plush toys) in a non-systematic but purposeful sequence. Humans often exhibit saccades to semantically relevant or visually salient objects scattered throughout the scene, as seen here. The scanpath also includes revisits (e.g., from [313, 222] to [312, 215]), a common human trait indicating re-evaluation or interest. The diverse and context-sensitive fixations suggest human exploration rather than a synthetic or algorithmic traversal.'},\n",

These erratic back-and-forth movements across small yet disjointed regions — especially repeated revisits to very similar or identical areas ([450, 106] and [445, 117]) without apparent semantic stimulus — are less typical of human visual behavior in a cluttered scene.

It begins around the center of the image ([621, 543]), likely attracted by the person’s face or central action area. It then shifts to adjacent, contextually interesting regions (around shelves with toys, especially near the woman’s hand and items pointed out by her gesture), followed by longer saccades to visually salient areas such as the bright toy boxes on far left and top right.

It begins with exploration of the central shelf area (points clustered around [654, 518] to [552, 389]), which contains many visually and semantically rich objects like plates, cups, and silverware. The gaze then shifts to more remote or peripheral areas such as the upper right shelves ([910, 182], [1000, 146]), the far left with the vase and window ([184, 176], [118, 175]), and finally progresses to the lower half of the scene including the sink and objects on the countertop ([451, 715] to [1053, 862]).\\n\\nThis broad and seemingly spontaneous yet meaningful exploration reflects a typical human scanpath pattern. The jumps from object to object (likely driven by shape, contrast, or meaning), such as from the framed picture to decorative objects or from functional items like the sink to dishes, emphasize human-like attentional shifts based on interest, familiarity, and curiosity.

Humans usually exhibit a more localized exploration within interesting regions before making large saccades.\\n\\n2. **Unnatural Order**: The scanpath moves from the central snack machine ([660, 512]) to far bottom-left ([40, 208]), then jumps across to top-right extremities and scans along the right edge in a rigid path ([1040, 160] to [1260, 160], [1260, 496] etc.). This sequence feels overly systematic and less influenced by content saliency.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Revisits and Fixation Clusters**: Human viewers tend to repeatedly fixate on particular visually-rich or decision-relevant areas (like the center snack machine). Here, there's no strong evidence of revisits or fixation clusters around any specific set of objects.\\n\\n4. **Uniformity Over Semantics**: The scanpath seems more interested in covering space (especially the top-right and right edges) rather than focusing on the central, content-rich vending machine with varied packaging and text – which humans tend to find more engaging.\\n\\nHence, these patterns suggest an artificial gaze strategy likely produced by an AI model.\"},\n",

There’s a sharp jump to the upper left region ([267, 164], [271, 142]), likely driven by curiosity or the presence of salient packaging. Then it switches abruptly to the right-side drink machines ([937, 460] to [1229, 539]), suggesting exploration of an alternative choice.

The eye movements are relatively large and jump between distant points in a manner that lacks the localized clustering or smooth transitions typical of human gaze during free viewing. For example, the early fixations quickly move from right (x≈1173) to far left (x≈167) with minimal intermediate points, which is uncommon for humans who tend to inspect adjacent items before shifting far across a visual scene. Additionally, the scanpath revisits similar zones sparsely, unlike a human who often makes short saccades around areas of visual interest. The abrupt jumps and low fixation density in salient or centrally clustered object areas reinforce the impression of algorithmic, rather than natural, gaze behavior.'},\n",

It begins centrally at [637, 521], where the grilled meat and grill dominate the scene, a strong focal point due to its salience and central placement. It then moves to surrounding areas with diverse and colorful food items (e.g., [492, 634] and [487, 289]) and back to the right ([923, 321], [698, 176], [783, 186]). The transitions suggest exploratory behavior with a bias toward visually and semantically rich elements. The attention later returns again to food dishes, making longer and somewhat irregular jumps (e.g., [1003, 363] to [1068, 682] and back to [409, 824]), aligning with human tendencies to be both curious and reflective during such tasks.

Specifically, points like [937, 305] to [1126, 342] show excessive fixations within a narrow region over and over on similar vehicles, suggesting an algorithmic scanning pattern rather than a human's natural exploration. Additionally, a human viewer would likely exhibit greater variance in examining different areas of interest, like highly salient or anomalous vehicles in different regions (e.g., red or gold cars, or vehicles parked irregularly). The return to the final point [423, 682] also seems abrupt and inconsistent with natural human viewing.\"},\n",
