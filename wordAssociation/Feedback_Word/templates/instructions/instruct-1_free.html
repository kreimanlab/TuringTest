			 In each trial of this task you will be given two words in English. One of the word is a 'cue word' and the other word is its association. The association has been made by either a human or an AI model.

<p> Your task is to decide whether the association has been made by  <STRONG>  a human OR by AI.	  </STRONG> <br>
<p>

	You will be presented with 90 such pairs of cue word and association. 
	<p>
	For the first 40 trials, the correct answer is provided after you submit your answer; for the rest 50 trials, no feedback is given



		<p>

		</p>

	    <STRONG>NOTE: Below is a sample trial. In this example, the given cue word is 'dog', and the subject's (AI or human) association is 'cat'.   <br> The worker here thinks that the association has been made by a human </STRONG>
